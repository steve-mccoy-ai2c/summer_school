## Hands-On #1

Welcome! These exercises are designed to help you get comfortable with basic Linux file system commands.

### Exercise 0: Clone the starting repository

1. Open WSL
2. Run the following command to clone the initial file structure
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shafe123/AI2C-IntroToLinux.git
    ```
3. Verify the folder was cloned
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
4. Change directory into the newly cloned folder
    ```bash
    cd AI2C-IntroToLinux
    ```

### Exercise 1: Navigation

1. List all files and directories in the current folder.
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

2. Change directory into `notes`, then list the files.
   ```bash
   cd notes
   ls
   ```

3. Go back to the parent directory.
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

### Exercise 2: File Viewing

1. View the contents of `file1.txt`.
   ```bash
   cat file1.txt
   ```

2. Use `less` or `more` to view `file2.txt`.

### Exercise 3: File Management

1. Copy `file2.txt` into the `docs` directory.
   ```bash
   cp file2.txt docs/
   ```

2. Move `file1.txt` into the `notes` directory and rename it as file3.
   ```bash
   mv file1.txt notes/file3.txt
   ```

3. Create a new file named `newfile.txt`.
   ```bash
   touch newfile.txt
   ```

4. Delete `newfile.txt`.
   ```bash
   rm newfile.txt
   ```

### Exercise 4: Permissions and Execution

1. View permissions of `scripts/hello.sh`.
    ```bash
    ls -l scripts/hello.sh
    ```

2. Make `hello.sh` executable and run it.
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/hello.sh
    ./scripts/hello.sh
    ```

## Hands-On #2

These exercises are designed to help you practice using tools like `grep`, `wc`, `ssh`, and redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`).

### Exercise 5: GREP - Search Text

1. Search for the word "Linux" in `file1.txt`.
   ```bash
   grep "Linux" file1.txt
   ```

2. Search for lines **not** containing "Linux".
   ```bash
   grep -v "Linux" file1.txt
   ```

3. Search recursively in all `.txt` files under the current directory.
   ```bash
   grep -r "Linux" .
   ```

4. Find lines starting with the word "Note".
   ```bash
   grep "^Note" notes/note1.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 6: WC - Word/Line/Character Count

1. Count the number of lines in `file2.txt`.
   ```bash
   wc -l file2.txt
   ```

2. Count the number of words and characters in `docs/doc1.txt`.
   ```bash
   wc -w -m docs/doc1.txt
   ```

3. Get a summary for all `.txt` files.
   ```bash
   wc *.txt
   ```

### Exercise 7: SSH - Remote Access (Assumes you have SSH access to a server)

(working draft.............)

> Replace `user@hostname` with your SSH server credentials.

1. Connect to a remote server.
   ```bash
   ssh user@hostname
   ```

2. Run a remote command (e.g., list home directory files).
   ```bash
   ssh user@hostname ls ~
   ```

3. Copy a local file to the remote server.
   ```bash
   scp file1.txt user@hostname:~
   ```

---

### Exercise 8: Redirection Operators

1. Redirect the output of `ls` into a file.
   ```bash
   ls > filelist.txt
   ```

2. Append output to an existing file.
   ```bash
   echo "Another line" >> filelist.txt
   ```

3. Use input redirection to provide data to a command.
   ```bash
   wc -w < file2.txt
   ```

4. Chain commands with a pipe: count the number of files containing "Note".
   ```bash
   grep -r "Note" . | wc -l
   ```

5. Combine multiple operators: search a file and save results.
   ```bash
   grep "Note" notes/note1.txt > notes_found.txt
   ```

## Stretch Goals:

**Goal**:  Try to determine how many text files there are in the original repository.

**Goal**:  Which file in the repository `https://github.com/shafe123/AI2C-LinuxLarge.git` has a hidden message? (hint: you can do this just with grep)
